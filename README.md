# Churn-Data-Prediction
Churn Data Prediction using Logistic Regression. In this Machine learning model I used Supervised Learning. Here Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. This Churn Data Prediction model I using Logistic Regression, it uses a different method for estimating the parameters, which gives better resultsâ€“better meaning unbiased, with lower variances. Get beyond the frustration of learning odds ratios, logit link functions, and proportional odds assumptions on your own.
